# Heart_disease
Heart disease Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on various health factors using machine learning algorithms. It leverages data on a variety of attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors to create a predictive model that helps in early detection and diagnosis.
#Technologies Used
 Programming Language:Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks 
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
# Steps
This project uses various machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A classifier that works well in high-dimensional spaces.
We perform the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
Model Training: Train multiple models to evaluate their performance.
Evaluation: Measure the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Results
After evaluating different models, we found that Logistic Regression performs the best in predicting heart disease with an accuracy of 90%. Visualizations of the modelâ€™s performance can be found in the results section of the notebook.
